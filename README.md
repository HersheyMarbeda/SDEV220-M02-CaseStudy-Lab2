# SDEV220-M02-CaseStudy-Lab2
- Programming Exercise on if/else and while loops

## Assignment Description
- The case-study programming exercise requires the students to write a Python app that will accept student names and GPAs and test if the student qualifies for either the Dean's List or the Honor Roll. 

## My Methods 
- I utilized if-elif and while loops to write my program. I spefically used if-elif for input validation and GPA qualification. I used while loop to keep the program running until the user decides to terminate the program.
